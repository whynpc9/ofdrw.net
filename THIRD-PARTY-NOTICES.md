# Third-Party Notices

Ofdrw.Net depends on the following third-party packages. This notice records
their package-declared licenses and source locations; it does not select a
license for Ofdrw.Net itself.

| Package | Version | License | Source |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Docnet.Core | 2.6.0 | MIT | https://github.com/GowenGit/docnet |

| MigraDocCore.Rendering | 1.3.67 | MIT | https://github.com/ststeiger/PdfSharpCore |

Transitive dependencies are resolved by NuGet and may change as direct
dependencies are updated. Consumers should use the generated dependency graph
and the corresponding package metadata when performing a release compliance
review.

DOCX conversion invokes a separately installed LibreOffice executable. Ofdrw.Net
does not bundle or redistribute LibreOffice; consumers are responsible for its
installation and for reviewing the applicable LibreOffice license notices.

On macOS, DOCX conversion may instead automate a separately installed Microsoft
Word application for higher layout fidelity. Ofdrw.Net does not bundle Microsoft
Word or Microsoft Office fonts. The LibreOffice backend may reference installed
Office fonts in place, but does not copy them into the package or repository.


The Issue 05 development/E2E fixtures include unmodified LXGW WenKai and Noto
Sans fonts under SIL OFL 1.1, with pinned upstream commit URLs and SHA-256 in
`e2e/Ofdrw.Net.FontSubset.E2E/testdata/fonts/upstream-manifest.json`. Their
original license files accompany the fonts. These fixtures are not included
in the production NuGet packages. Modified LXGW subsets replace Reserved Font
Names while retaining copyright and license records. Subsetting does not grant
embedding rights. The managed subset implementation introduces no third-party
runtime backend; HarfBuzz/fonttools used for independent development probes are
not production dependencies.
